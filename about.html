      <h2 class="section-title">Our Origin</h2>
      <p>
        Born in the heart of India, <strong>INDULGE</strong> began as a small family bakery inspired by the rich heritage of Indian sweets and the artistry of global desserts. 
        What started as a passion project in a cozy kitchen soon transformed into a nationwide brand loved for its handcrafted delicacies.
        Each dessert we create reflects India’s diverse culinary culture blended with international finesse — a celebration of taste, texture, and tradition.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our philosophy is simple — to bring happiness in every bite. 
        At INDULGE, we believe desserts are not just food, but an experience that connects people, moments, and memories.

      <h2 class="section-title">Authentic Ingredients</h2>
      <p>
        At <strong>INDULGE</strong>, every dessert begins with premium, healthy ingredients sourced responsibly from local and international farms. 
        We use organic cocoa, cold-pressed oils, natural sweeteners, and farm-fresh dairy to ensure the perfect balance between taste and nutrition.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our commitment to authenticity drives us to avoid artificial colors, preservatives, or flavor enhancers — 
        making every creation not only delicious but also wholesome. From pure Madagascar vanilla to sustainably sourced almonds, 
        every component in our desserts is chosen with care and integrity.
